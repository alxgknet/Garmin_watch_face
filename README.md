Make a face for Garmin watch



This is a fun project to customize my Garmin vivoactive watch that I already had for a while.

Traveling across the world, I was curious about elevation or altitude of each place I go through.

I decided to add this information on face of my watch.

It was also interesting to try a new programing language Monkey C. During this exercise, I found that it supports a MVC architecture that makes coding very easy.

I used Visual Studio Code as an IDE.
